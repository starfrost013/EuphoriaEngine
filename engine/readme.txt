Zombono
Test Build 4
Pre-Alpha
XXXXXXXXX XX, 2023

Zombono is (will be) a retro-inspired 3d class-based team shooter, based on a Quake 1 sourceport with various engine improvements, where one side is the left 4 dead 2 director and the other side are normal players; currently the only mode is Team Deathmatch; hostage rescue and many other modes are planned to be implemented eventually.

NOTES:
* Release notes are in the releasenotes.txt file. Just run the game!
* The default resolution is 640*480. I provided some batch files to launch the game at a few of the most common modern resolutions (this will be resolved later):
	* Use Launch_Laptop if you have a 1366x768 display.
	* Use Launch_1080p if you have a 1080p display.
	* Use Launch_1440p if you have a 1440p display.
	* Use Launch_4K if you have a 4K display.

If you don't have one of these resolutions, use the -width and -height command line arguments, or use the Options menu (accessible by F4 in game) to set the video mode.

* This is a PRE-ALPHA build and development has not been going on very long at all, so some things are buggy and won't work, and a lot of features are unimplemented.
* You cannot host servers at this time because of the very early state of the game.
* Tests are expected weekly, unless I'm busy.
* You will be randomly assigned to a team on joining, there is no team switching UI yet. The team colors are on the bottom-left corner, but you can also view them on the Tab menu.
* If you are director, press 9 to get the Zombinator, it's accessible at all times.
* The victory condition for this build is the first to 50 frags.
* Some weapons have been tweaked already if you are used to playing Quake 1.
* You can jump 15 percent higher than normal Quake physics.
* UI auto-scaling has been implemented. scr_autoscale 0 will turn it off.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* Your weapon doesn't appear until you click.
