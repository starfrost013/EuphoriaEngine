Zombono
Release Notes
Version 0.04-pre5
February XX, 2024
* Fixed Gender option in player setup menu changing handedness instead of gender.
* Many more details in z_tdm_subway.
* Added Load_PicRegion and Draw_Pic to legacy OpenGL renderer, to draw certain sections of pics.
* Made the leaderboard translucent.
* Changed GL_FindPic to not always load 2D images from the "pics" folder (for the purposes of loading fonts). Therefore, if you see any Prigozhin's, report them.
* Ogre changes:
	* They move a lot slower.
	* Changed health from 40 to 90.
* Implemented walk-through walls that work like Quake 1's func_illusionary into the engine. They are toggled by creating a func_wall with spawnflag 32 (FGD description: Walk-Through). They work with triggers.
* Many fixes to geometry and textures in z_tdm_labrats. Made the hidden room a secret and allowed both teams to access it. I'm not sure how good this is.
* Many more posters and details in z_tdm_subway.
* Rename skyboxes
* Made the "Police Line do not Cross" thing blow you up in z_tdm_subway.
* Add a "Browse Servers" button to multiplayer menu - does not work yet.
* Added real ogre sound effects (thanks Zorg)
* Engine Limits:
	* Max Lightmaps 128 -> 256
	* Max BSP Mem Allocation (actual maximum filesize will be slightly less) 16MB -> 64MB
	* Max MD2 Mem Allocation (actual maximum filesize will be slightly less) 2MB -> 8MB
	* Max SP2 Mem Allocation (actual maximum filesize will be slightly less) 64KB -> 256KB
		* This does not increase memory use as the memory is not committed until it is used by the BSP/MD2/SP2 loader.
	* May increase further, esp. for SP2s (which may just be replaced with UV-mapped TGAs entirely but not sure) but will be considered later
	* Lightmap Sub-map Block Size 128x128 -> 256x256 (seems to prevent a buffer overflow, only 16x16 lightmap textures per map as well)
		* This **DOES NOT REDUCE QUALITY**, as mapping is done within each block based on the BSP tree.
	* QPath 80 -> 256 chars (PAK files won't be compatible with Quake2, and slightly higher mem usage)
* MAJOR ENGINE CHANGE:
	* Positions are now floats rather than fixed-points with 12 bits of mantissa and 3 exponent bits. This means worlds can be larger than 8192 units across, but 			PLEASE TEST FOR MOVEMENT BUGS!
	* The actual practical limit, owing to issues with lightmap generation, ericw-tools QBSP scalability issues, and long loading times is somewhere between 27000 and 27500 units across.
* Made some error messages more verbose.
* Added several debugging cvars.
	* cl_showposition - Shows your position.
	* cl_showvelocity - Shows your velocity.	
	* These will probably be replaced with a more full-featured debug at some point.
* Fixed bug where pressing X would make you say "score" (it used to bring up the old leaderboard)
* Don't enforce TDM rules on non-TDM.

Version 0.04-pre4
February 10, 2024
* Fix TDM end screen not displaying.
* Push zombies away if they hit a player while being spawned. This should prevent players from being trapped by zombies.
* Reset the state of all active UIs on connect and disconnect (should at least mitigate "stuck UI" bugs)
* Directors killing zombies don't get frags anymore. Players killing zombies have a separate score tallied up for that. Not sure what to do with this rn... Directors killing zombies lose that score.
* Fixed a bug where, on team change, weapons were not being visually indicated.
* Very rough implementation of primary and secondary attack (presently, only attack functions and state are separated, animations and reload time aren't)
	* Renamed +attack to +attack1
	* Added +attack2
* Bamfuslicator now allows changing which zombie type to spawn.
	* Use right click to do this.
* Removed right click to strafe (and therefore +strafe binding).
* Removed by default CTRL to shoot.
* Capitalised binding names.
* Properly lit and textured z_tdm_subway, and added many new details.
* Redesigned textures for z_tdm_labrats. They suck.
* Rewrote the way the game version number is handled and drawn.
* Added cl_drawhud: It determines if UI is drawn.
* Removed scr_printspeed - it was dummied out and obsolete
* Implemented very rough versions of new enemy types that can be spawned with the Planfuslicator:
	* Fast Zombies: Zombies that wander around randomly and move twice as fast, in a char
	* Ogres: They will have a range attack in the future and move slowly. The Shrek voice lins are temporary.
* Added gender option in player setup menu.

Version 0.04-pre3
January 14, 2024
* Began designing textures for z_tdm_labrats
* Added total player and director scores to leaderboard UI
* Removed old scoreboard from Quake2
* Leaderboard now updates in real time
* You don't have to press tab to hide the leaderboard anymore, it just hides itself when you stop holding tab
* Rewrote how screenshot function generates filenames. Therefore, it doesn't check for the existence of 100 files by fopen()-ing them every single time you take a screenshot, and you can now take more than 100 screenshots. It also now puts the date in the filename as a way to differentiate screenshots from each other.
* Removed vulkan renderer for now (don't have scope or ability to maintain both renderers, and I have plans to write a GL3 renderer)
* Fixed zombie animations, changed zombie speed a bit.
* Ported particle engine to 32-bit colour
* Changed conback and made a 16*9 widescreen conback.
* Better integrated new UI -you won't slide around anymore, and you still can't input commands to the player while a UI is active.
* Changed zombies to be a green colour.
* Fixed zombie gibs - they were pointing to the wrong model path, and those models were pointing to the wrong textures.
* Default intensity convar value changed from 2 to 1.2. Is it too dark?
* Fixed fullscreen mode. As a result of this, the resolution you select in settings will now actually correspond to the resolution that is set.
* Changed icons.
* Frags actually show correctly in leaderboard.
* Increased map vis data size limit from 1mb to 4mb. This is to facilitate map development so maps can be run with -fast vis (slow vis will be under the limit, but will take a very long time to compile on maps with many detailed angles, 15-30 minutes on a modern PC, or even longer)
* Added "gameversion" command (which was intended to be implemented in Quake 2)
* Added a prompt on how to use the main menu, someone struggled with this.
* New map - z_tdm_subway! Still blockout though

Version 0.04-pre2
December 31, 2023
* Reduced Bamfuslicator range from 1024 to 768 units
* z_tdm_labrats improvements - use actual cylindrical pillars, add more lights and decoration
* Make directors 25% slower than Players
* Added a new leaderboard!
* Fixed being able to move around while team UI is active. This caused teamkilling.
* Fixed the Zombie textures
* Targa images now have a missing texture targa loaded in their place when they fail to load
* TDM gameplay flow - both teams can win/lose/draw
* Zombies no longer target directors unless GF_ITEM_FRIENDLY_FIRE is enabled
* Changed many more icons
* Unified drawstring functions
* Increased maximum controls per UI from 32 to 256. They aren't dynamically allocated yet, sorry for 2 megabytes of your ram.
* Did some more work on z_tdm_ussr, but nowhere near complete
* Increase number of messages before the chat scrolls from 4 to 9
* Fixed lighting on second floor of z_tdm_labrats
