Zombono
Release Notes
Version 0.04-pre4
February XX, 2024
* Fix TDM end screen not displaying.
* Push zombies away if they hit a player while being spawned. This should prevent players from being trapped by zombies.
* Reset the state of all active UIs on connect and disconnect (should at least mitigate "stuck UI" bugs)
* Directors killing zombies don't get frags anymore. Players kilng zombies have a separate score tallied up for that. Not sure what to do with this rn... Directors killing zombies lose that score.
* Fixed a bug where, on team change, weapons were not being visually indicated.
* Very rough implementation of primary and secondary attack (presently, only attack functions and state are separated, animations and reload time aren't)
	* Renamed +attack to +attack1
	* Added +attack2
* Bamfuslicator now allows changing which zombie type to spawn.
	* Use right click to do this.
* Removed right click to strafe (and therefore +strafe binding).
* Removed by default CTRL to shoot.
* Capitalised binding names.
* Properly lit and textured z_tdm_subway, and added many new details.
* Redesigned textures for z_tdm_labrats. They suck.
* Rewrote the way the game version number is handled.
* Added cl_drawui: It determines if UI is drawn.

Version 0.04-pre3
January 14, 2024
* Began designing textures for z_tdm_labrats
* Added total player and director scores to leaderboard UI
* Removed old scoreboard from Quake2
* Leaderboard now updates in real time
* You don't have to press tab to hide the leaderboard anymore, it just hides itself when you stop holding tab
* Rewrote how screenshot function generates filenames. Therefore, it doesn't check for the existence of 100 files by fopen()-ing them every single time you take a screenshot, and you can now take more than 100 screenshots. It also now puts the date in the filename as a way to differentiate screenshots from each other.
* Removed vulkan renderer for now (don't have scope or ability to maintain both renderers, and I have plans to write a GL3 renderer)
* Fixed zombie animations, changed zombie speed a bit.
* Ported particle engine to 32-bit colour
* Changed conback and made a 16*9 widescreen conback.
* Better integrated new UI -you won't slide around anymore, and you still can't input commands to the player while a UI is active.
* Changed zombies to be a green colour.
* Fixed zombie gibs - they were pointing to the wrong model path, and those models were pointing to the wrong textures.
* Default intensity convar value changed from 2 to 1.2. Is it too dark?
* Fixed fullscreen mode. As a result of this, the resolution you select in settings will now actually correspond to the resolution that is set.
* Changed icons.
* Frags actually show correctly in leaderboard.
* Increased map vis data size limit from 1mb to 4mb. This is to facilitate map development so maps can be run with -fast vis (slow vis will be under the limit, but will take a very long time to compile on maps with many detailed angles, 15-30 minutes on a modern PC, or even longer)
* Added "gameversion" command (which was intended to be implemented in Quake 2)
* Added a prompt on how to use the main menu, someone struggled with this.
* New map - z_tdm_subway! Still blockout though

* TDM gameplay flow - both teams can win/lose/draw
* Zombies no longer target directors unless GF_ITEM_FRIENDLY_FIRE is enabled

* Increase number of messages before the chat scrolls from 4 to 9
* Fixed lighting on second floor of z_tdm_labrats
